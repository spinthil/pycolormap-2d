# This workflow runs tests, linting, and publishes Python distributions to PyPI.
# It tests compatibility across multiple Python versions (3.9-3.13) and performs
# code quality checks (linting with flake8 and type checking with mypy).
# On main branch: publishes to TestPyPI.
# On tags: publishes to production PyPI and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages.
# Runs on pushes to main/dev branches, tags, and pull requests.
